# python-sources

python-sources is a collection of versioned python source code from 2.7.x -> 3.5.x that is made available on github for linking and quick reference.

ever wanted to send a quick link to specific line numbers in the python stdlib's source code as referenced by that pesky traceback? now you can!

by navigating to the source code for the version in question and clicking on the line number, you can get a linkable reference for pasting into bug reports, chats, etc - e.g.:

```
https://github.com/kwlzn/python-sources/blob/master/Python-2.7.5/Lib/threading.py#L395
```
