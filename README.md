# python-sources

python-sources is a reference collection of versioned Python source code from 2.7.x -> 3.5.x that is made available on github for searching, linking and quick reference.

ever wanted to send a quick link to specific line numbers in the python stdlib's source code as referenced by that pesky traceback? now you can!

by navigating to the source code for the version in question and clicking on the line number, you can get a linkable reference for pasting into bug reports, chats, etc - e.g.:

- https://github.com/kwlzn/python-sources/blob/master/Python-2.7.5/Lib/threading.py#L395

or using the lesser known range syntax (in UI: click first line, hold shift, click last line):

- https://github.com/kwlzn/python-sources/blob/master/Python-2.7.5/Lib/threading.py#L392-L397
